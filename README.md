# huffman-encoding-program
A program that encodes a text file. It creates a huffman tree and encodes the characters by turning letters into 1's and 0's that take up less space. NOTE: the program does not actually compress text files as we did not learn bit manipulation, but it employs all other components of huffman encoding.


This program takes an input file and creates an output file that has a frequency count as the header and the encoded text below. The program also decodes an encoded text file, recreates the huffman tree, and then returns a text file with the original text.
